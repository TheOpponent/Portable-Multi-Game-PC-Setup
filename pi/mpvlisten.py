# Part of Lutero. https://github.com/TheOpponent/Lutero
# This file is in the public domain (Unlicense). https://unlicense.org

# Runs on a Raspberry Pi or similar device running mpv acting as digital
# signage, to drive the currently displayed media using MQTT messages on the
# "lutero/sign" topic. While the script is written for Linux, it can be adapted
# for any platform that supports mpv and mpvsocket.
# This script runs at boot connects to a Unix socket created by
# mpv --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket.
# It assumes the MQTT broker is on the same local network and accepts anonymous
# connections.

# Special commands include:
# "^reset" - Unsets the current image and returns to an idle loop.
# "^quit" - Shuts the Raspberry Pi down.

# Uses paho-mqtt.

# Set to path for the idle loop. This can be a single file or a directory with
# multiple files, which will be loaded as a playlist. Use mpv config or command
# line options to control how directories are loaded (e.g. shuffle, still image
# duration).
IDLE_PATH = "/home/pi/Pictures/idle/"

# Set to path for game-specific media. Use {title} where the game name will be
# substituted, which is included in the MQTT message. The default setting 
# will use PNG files for all games, but this can be replaced with a different
# file type. To use different types per file, the MQTT message must include the
# complete file name with extension for all games, and no extension used here.
